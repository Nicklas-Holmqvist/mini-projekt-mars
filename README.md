# This is an app/site about Mars, showing photos taken by the mars-rovers.

A school-asignment on getting started with React.
The focus of the assignment was to get familiar with, Routing, Errorboundarys, presenting API's and an over all
familiarity with coding in React.
We used NASA's API for Rover-photos.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
